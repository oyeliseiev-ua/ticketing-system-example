# Ticketing System

A simple microservice example using Spring Boot, Kafka and the Outbox Pattern to ensure reliable event publishing and message consumption.  
The service demonstrates receiving events via Kafka, persisting them to a database, and using clean architecture principles.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup & Run Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oyeliseiev-ua/ticketing-system-example.git
cd ticketing-system-example
```

### Start Kafka & Kafka UI using Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This will start:
* Kafka broker (port 9092)
* Zookeeper (port 2181)
* Kafka UI (port 8081)
* Network: ticketing-system-net

### Run the Spring Boot Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Submit a Ticket via REST API
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ticket/submit
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "subject": "IT",
  "description": "Provide macbook laptop"
}
```

### Check Kafka Messages in Kafka UI
* Open http://localhost:8081
* Navigate to support-tickets topic
* Confirm the ticket message is received.

### Produce a Test Message to Assign a Ticket
Send a message to the Kafka topic ticket-assignments via Kafka UI or CLI:
```json
{
  "ticketId": 1,
  "assigneeId": "agent-007"
}
```
Check logs: Ticket 1 is successfully assigned to agent-007

### Produce a Test Message to Update Ticket Status
Send a message to the Kafka topic ticket-updates via Kafka UI or CLI:
```json
{
  "ticketId": 1,
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```
Check logs: Ticket 1 status is successfully updated

## Message Formats

### Ticket Submission Event

```json
{
  "id": "number",
  "userId": "string",
  "subject": "string",
  "description": "string"
}
```

### Ticket Assignment Event

```json
{
  "ticketId": "number",
  "assigneeId": "string"
}
```

### Ticket Update Event

```json
{
  "ticketId": "number",
  "status": "string"
}
```

## Design Decisions

* Outbox Pattern ‚Äî ensures ticket submission events are first saved in the database before publishing to Kafka for reliability.
* Since Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery for consumers, the ID of the submitted ticket is used as Ticket id to check before persist to handle idempotency.
* Separate Service Layer ‚Äî the Kafka listener delegates database writes to a TicketService.
* Transactional Safety ‚Äî database operations are wrapped in @Transactional to ensure atomicity.
* Config via Properties ‚Äî Kafka topics and group IDs are injected from application.properties for flexibility.
* Retries & Error Handling ‚Äî any failures throw exceptions, allowing Spring Kafka to retry message consumption.
* Lombok ‚Äî reduces boilerplate code in entities, DTOs, and services.
* H2 Database ‚Äî lightweight in-memory database for development and testing.
